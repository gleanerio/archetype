      "    \"description\": \"A healthy environment is one of the cornerstones of the European model of sustainable development. Moreover, our natural and cultural heritage defines our common European identity and thus its preservation for present and future generations is one of our utmost responsibilities. Being a European centre of scientific and technical reference covering the entire range of environmental sciences, the European Commission's Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) is at the forefront in providing research-based support for the development and implementation of European environmental policies. These days, the IES is not only a respected partner of many first class research institutes in Member States, Candidate Countries and further afield, but together with strategic partners like the European Environment Agency and the European Space Agency is a key player in delivering results of cutting-edge basic and applied environmental research to society. Last, but certainly not least, and due to the very nature of the environment, the IES uses its expertise and state-of-the-art research facilities to act globally in cooperation with major international organisations. Four priorities will drive our research in the years to come: &bull; Environment and prosperity. We are firmly convinced that environmental concerns are no obstacle for European competitiveness, but on the contrary are a key for achieving Europe&rsquo;s aim of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based society in the world. &bull; Environment and solidarity. We support the common goal of providing equal access to a healthy environment to all European citizens. At the same time, we perceive solidarity as intergenerational justice, allowing future generations to choose their own priorities for development. &bull; Environment and security.

Moreover, our natural and cultural heritage defines our common European identity and thus its preservation for present and future generations is one of our utmost responsibilities. Being a European centre of scientific and technical reference covering the entire range of environmental sciences, the European Commission's Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) is at the forefront in providing research-based support for the development and implementation of European environmental policies. These days, the IES is not only a respected partner of many first class research institutes in Member States, Candidate Countries and further afield, but together with strategic partners like the European Environment Agency and the European Space Agency is a key player in delivering results of cutting-edge basic and applied environmental research to society. Last, but certainly not least, and due to the very nature of the environment, the IES uses its expertise and state-of-the-art research facilities to act globally in cooperation with major international organisations. Four priorities will drive our research in the years to come: &bull; Environment and prosperity. We are firmly convinced that environmental concerns are no obstacle for European competitiveness, but on the contrary are a key for achieving Europe&rsquo;s aim of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based society in the world. &bull; Environment and solidarity. We support the common goal of providing equal access to a healthy environment to all European citizens.
