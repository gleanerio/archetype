## About

In this flow we will talk about the elements needed in the publishing phase.  At this point
we have our JSON-LD documents formed and enabled at our site. We need to make them available to 
people via the web architecture now.  

## Details

__robots.txt & sitemap.xml__

For these topics, lets visit the OIH [the publishing page](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/publishing/publishing.html)

__community registries__

Though not required, a community might have some registries that they use.  In the Ocean InfoHub
project, for example, we use Ocean Catalog and Ocean Experts to hold information on resources, 
people and organizations.

- show [Ocean Catalog](https://catalogue.odis.org/) and example entry for [BCO-DMO](https://catalogue.odis.org/view/3287)
- show [Ocean Expert](https://oceanexpert.org) entry for [me](https://oceanexpert.org/expert/44151) 

## Activity


__First, some fun with bash__

[Shell Scraping](./shellScraping.md) describes using the UNIX shell environment to do quick easy
inspection of sitemaps and web pages with JSON-LD.

You can also look again at some of the tools in the [tooling page](../../docs/tooling.md)
