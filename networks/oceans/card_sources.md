## About

In this flow we will talk about the elemenmts needed in the publishing phase.  

## Details

__robots.txt__


__sitemap.xml__


__community registries__

Though not required, a community might have some registries that they use.  In the Ocean InfoHub
project, for example, we use Ocean Catalog and Ocean Experts to hold information on resources, 
people and organizations.

- show [Ocean Catalog](https://catalogue.odis.org/) and example entry for [BCO-DMO](https://catalogue.odis.org/view/3287)
- show ocean export entry https://oceanexpert.org/expert/44151
