For these topics, lets visit the OIH [the publishing page](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/publishing/publishing.html)

__community registries__

Though not required, a community might have some registries that they use.  In the Ocean InfoHub
project, for example, we use Ocean Catalog and Ocean Experts to hold information on resources, 
people and organizations.

- show [Ocean Expert](https://oceanexpert.org) entry for [me](https://oceanexpert.org/expert/44151)
