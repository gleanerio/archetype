## About

Once we have formed a Knowledge Graph (KG), there are many things we can do with it.  
It is, in a manner, a master data catalogue for a community of practice.  

## Details



## Activity

### Query


* In Oxigraph UI (SPARQL examples)
* In jupyter with rdflib loading release graphs
  * NOTEBOOK: [sparql.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/sparql.ipynb)

### Data products from query

Building data products from the KG

* Build an example data product 
  * NOTEBOOK: [mdpLite.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/mdpLite.ipynb)
* Demonstrate using DuckDB on a parquet product 
  * NOTEBOOK: [mdpDuckDB.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/mdpDuckDB.ipynb)

### Make a graph network

Convert to a network and visualize it [ODIS/OIH viz](https://github.com/iodepo/odis-arch/tree/schema-dev-df/graphOps/graphVisualization)

* NOTEBOOK: [graph2NetworkViz.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/graph2NetworkViz.ipynb)
* NOTEBOOK: [networkViz.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/networkViz.ipynb)
