## About

Once we have formed a Knowledge Graph (KG), there are many things we can do with it.  
It is, in a manner, a master data catalogue for a community of practice.

### Data products from query

Building data products from the KG

* Build an example data product 
  * __NOTEBOOK:__ [mdpLite.ipynb](../commons/notebooks/mdpLite.ipynb)
