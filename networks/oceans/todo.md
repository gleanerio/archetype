# TODO

* [x] explore the depth approach, note this in the presentation as an example of the community process
* [x] document the cli scripts pointing to specific docker images and potential issues there
* [ ] MDP code 
* [ ] qdrant workflow in a notebook, with loading and query
* [ ] talk about the ID relations across and between types, ie, what is forming the networks, PIDS vs IDs


## TODO

Note in the publishing phase that this published representation can and should be fully LOD 
inspired and let users walk the graph via the web abstraction to resources across the web.

Note that in the indexing phase, groups like OIH may not leverage all the information in the 
published data graphs.  Things like domain specific types and properties may not be leveraged by OIH.
They may be part of the KG, but not actively used.  Though they would be in the published graphs.

This is where groups like DeCODER come in to address more domain specific approaches and where
the ability to cross-link the graphs and UXs from both of those is powerful.  


## Index times

They all run in about 10 minutes give or take 2 or 3 minutes.  
OBIS needs a --rude to override robots.txt

However, oceanexpert, takes about 1.5 hours and BCODO is 55 hours at 10-second delays
Ocean Expert also has a 30-second delay which is ridiculous.
