# TODO

* [ ] explore the depth approach, note this in the presentation as an example of the community process
* [ ] document the cli scripts pointing to specific docker images and potential issues there
* [ ] document my use of podman vs the typical use of docker
* [ ] add in the gihub repos for odis and decoder
* [ ] review use of https://towardsdatascience.com/the-new-best-python-package-for-visualising-network-graphs-e220d59e054e
* [ ] MDP code 
* [ ] qdrant workflow in a notebook, with loading and query
* [ ] should I show the links to our current sources and planned sources  
* [ ] talk about the ID relations across and between types, ie, what is forming the networks, PIDS vs IDs


## TODO

Note in the phase where vocabularies are talked about to mention spatial elements

Note in the publishing phase that this published representation can and should be fully LOD 
inspired and let users walk the graph via the web abstraction to resources across the web.


Note that in the indexing phase, groups like OIH may not leverage all the information in the 
published data graphs.  Things like domain specific types and properties may not be leveraged by OIH.
They may be part of the KG, but not actively used.  Though they would be in the published graphs.

This is where groups like DeCODER come in to address more domain specific approaches and where
the ability to cross-link the graphs and UXs from both of those is powerful.  


## Index times

They all run in about 10 minutes give or take 2 or 3 minutes.  
OBIS needs a --rude to override robots.txt

However, oceanexpert, takes about 1.5 hours and BCODO is 55 hours at 10-second delays
Ocean Expert also has a 30-second delay which is ridiculous. 


## conclusion concept

In the context of the ocean decade, it is interesting to think about how to connect data
to policy and goals.  What tools do we use to do this?  Can LLMs help connect SDG to data with the 
aid of KGs.    and how do we cite this?   


### Other notes

I've placed a few supporting notes in the [appendix](./appendix.md).

This work can also be seen in the frame of establishing an approach to assess the
state of the ocean data landscape.
