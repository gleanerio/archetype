# Working with Nabu

## About

The Nabu tool allows for the manipulation of JSON-LD based data graphs.  Nabu can be used to load data graphs into
triplestores like Oxigraph or others.

Additionally it can ba used to generate a "releas graph".  Here, the term release graph is used to denote a
single file holding all the RDF triples from the collected JSON-LD files.  This is serialized into a single
file using the NQuads format.
