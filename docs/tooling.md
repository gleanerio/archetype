# Tooling

## About

What follows are a set of tools and approaches to exploring graphs beyond the
classic use of SPARQL, SHACL or framing.

This collection is designed to provide a sample of the tools available
that might align with the skills and needs of the user.  Some are somewhat
novel applications of existing tools.  Some are more JSON tools, but that I 
have found useful for JSON-LD.   

The goal is to show some approaches that could be usd to explore graphs
to better understand how the encoding and representation of the information
is going.

Suggestions welcome.
