# Tooling

## About

This collection is designed to provide a sample of the tools available
that might align with the skills and needs of the user. Some are somewhat
novel applications of existing tools. Some are just JSON tools that I
have found useful for JSON-LD for some use cases.

I do not list all the various RDF or property graph servers.   There are many
and it is often personal preference or alignment to local factors that make
the decison.  I will note that my current go to is [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph)
for those wanting a recommendation.  I'd encourage research though since there
are factors that may make Oxigraph a poor choice for your use case. 

Suggestions welcome!
