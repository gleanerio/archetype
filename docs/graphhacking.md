# Graph  Hacking

## Context

This page is a bit of a placeholder for resources and material related to how a group
might look at leveraging a graph for engagement with research or educational communities. 

The process of creating domain focused graphs, while leveraging semantic and 
open world aware approaches, provides a starting point for connections and integration
with the larger web of data.  Groups could also be thinking about 
this in terms of FAIR or CARE principles as well.  

Looking at something like a hackathon or the relation, the following strucutre might 
provide a starting point for thinking about what would be involved. 


1) Introduction and Goal Setting: The hackathon should begin with an introduction of the theme and the goals of the event.
The organizers should communicate their expectations and encourage participants to share their ideas.

1) Team Formation: Participants should be divided into teams based on their interests, skills, and backgrounds. Each team
should have a leader who will manage the team's tasks and ensure they meet their goals.

1) Training and Resources: It's essential to provide resources and training for participants to familiarize themselves with
knowledge graphs, ocean data, policies, and sustainable development goals. Workshops, webinars, and online resources
could help participants develop their skills and improve their knowledge.

1) Ideation and Brainstorming: Participants should work together to come up with ideas for projects that use knowledge
graphs to address challenges related to oceans. Ideas could range from visualizing ocean data to developing tools that
support ocean sustainability.

1) Project Development: Once the teams have selected their projects, they should begin working on developing their
solutions. The organizers should provide support and resources to help teams overcome any challenges they face.

1) Presentations and Judging: Each team should prepare a presentation of their project, highlighting its impact,
innovation, and relevance to the theme. Judges should evaluate each project based on these criteria and select the
winners.

1) Awards and Closing Ceremony: The hackathon should conclude with an award ceremony where the winning teams are announced.
The organizers should also provide feedback and recognize the efforts of all participants. The closing ceremony should
encourage participants to continue working on their projects beyond the hackathon.

To accommodate remote work, the organizers could use online collaboration tools, communication channels, and video
conferencing to facilitate communication and collaboration among participants. They could also provide support and
guidance to ensure that participants have access to the necessary resources and can communicate effectively with their
teammates.
