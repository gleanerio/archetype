# Simple Indexing

## About

This is a profile for a personna that simply wants to fire up an architecture for
some simple indexing.

## Pre-requisists

This approach will leverage docker.  For an approach that works only in the command
line and file system see the CLI profile.

## Rough outline

* fire up the containers in aggregator/serverArch/DockerCompose.yml
* make config file
* use aggregator/harvesting/cliGleaner.sh
