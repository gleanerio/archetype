## About

This repository gives a basic set of tools and guides to allow someone to
get a feel for the structured data on the web approach. See the
[Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/) document for
details on this approach.

The examples here are intended as a way to quickly get a feel for the process
that is implemented to collect and work with the JSON-LD documents.

It was named _archetype_ originally since the plan was for it to be a core model 
with the fundamental characteristics, themes and motifs of a provider instance. 
However, it evolved from that to act more as a demonstrator for the workflow 
of an implementation across the range of personas.
