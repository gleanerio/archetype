# GleanerIO: Archetype

## About

This repository gives a basic set of tools and guides to allow someone to
get a feel for the structured data on the web approach. See the
[Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/) document for
details on this approach.

The examples here are intended as a way to quickly get a feel for the process
that is implemented to collect and work with the JSON-LD documents.

## Personas

Link to personas (and clean up there)

## Scripts and code

link to the tools and bash scripts as well as the Gleaner Nabu CLI code

### Quick start

## Implementation Networks

This is based on, but is not, the GoFAIR implementation networks

## Validation


## Workbench (if I still keep this concept)


## Activity Flow

A rough draft of the activity flow.  This is very Gleaner centric at this time which is not
required. So you can assume that Gleaner and Nabu could be replaced by other services.  Indeed,
the S3 and graph stores are also very optional.
