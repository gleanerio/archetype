# Harvesting

## About

In this directory are two main sections.  The rundir and the scripts directory.  The rundir
is the location where the commands are fired off.  It will be where your configuration
and log files will be.

The scripts are the simple bash scripts run to invoke the Docker images.  Note, there
are also Podman commands in there and I am working to bring these two together and
allow people to use either as the runtime.
