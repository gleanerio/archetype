# Reference UI

## About

This UI is designed to work with the Gleaner Indexing and Data Services stacks. It is 
a very simply UI that is not meant to be used in anything more than as a dev tool.  

I'll likely add https://triply.cc/docs/yasgui into this UI as a more useful default testing
environment / tool.

## Future

The UI aspect is completely decoupled from the Gleaner Indexing and Data Services.
Different communities will have different needs and requirements for the UI.
