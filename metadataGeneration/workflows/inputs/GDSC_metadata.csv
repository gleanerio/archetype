Years ago there was less understanding of how dumping or improper management of chemical wastes might adversely affect public health and the environment. The result of such practices was that hazardous substances contaminated thousands of properties across the nation. Congress passed legislation in 1980 that established the Superfund Program in order to locate, investigate and cleanup these sites. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers the Superfund Program in cooperation with the individual States and tribal governments. The Hazard Ranking System (HRS) is the principal mechanism that EPA uses to evaluate sites for the National Priorities List (NPL). It is a numerically based screening system that uses information from initial, limited investigations ""the preliminary assessment and the site inspection"" to assess the potential of sites to pose a threat to human health or the environment. Sites are listed on the NPL upon completion of Hazard Ranking System screening, public solicitation of comments about the proposed site, and after all comments have been addressed. The responsible parties may clean up the Superfund site under an agreement with EPA| or, EPA may clean up the site under a cost-share agreement using federal and state funds.

While not all addresses are able to be geocoded and mapped to 100% accuracy, we are continuously working to improve address data quality and enhance coverage. Please consider this issue when using any datasets provided by HUD.  When using this data, take note of the field titled “LVL2KX” which indicates the overall accuracy of the geocoded address using the following return codes: 
‘R’ - Interpolated rooftop (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green)  
‘4’ - ZIP+4 centroid (high degree of accuracy, symbolized as green) 
‘B’ - Block group centroid (medium degree of accuracy, symbolized as yellow)  
‘T’ - Census tract centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)  
‘2’ - ZIP+2 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red) 
 ‘Z’ - ZIP5 centroid (low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red) 
‘5’ - ZIP5 centroid (same as above, low degree of accuracy, symbolized as red)  
Null - Could not be geocoded (does not appear on the map)  

For the purposes of displaying the location of an address on a map only use addresses and their associated lat/long coordinates where the LVL2KX field is coded ‘R’ or ‘4’. These codes ensure that the address is displayed on the correct street segment and in the correct census block. The remaining LVL2KX codes provide a cascading indication of the most granular level geography for which an address can be confirmed. For example, if an address cannot be accurately interpolated to a rooftop (‘R’), or ZIP+4 centroid (‘4’), then the address will be mapped to the centroid of the next nearest confirmed geography: block group, tract, and so on. When performing any point-in polygon analysis it is important to note that points mapped to the centroids of larger geographies will be less likely to map accurately to the smaller geographies of the same area. For instance, a point coded as ‘5’ in the correct ZIP Code will be less likely to map to the correct block group or census tract for that address. In an effort to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the characteristics for each building are suppressed with a -4 value when the “Number_Reported” is equal to, or less than 10.

Summary statistics for the current year are incomplete because data are still being reported and quality assured. Data for the current year are considered preliminary until May 1 of the following year. Therefore, comparing reported values for the current year with previous years may not be valid.

A collection of vector polygon features for water bodies within the Urban Development Boundary (UDB) and outside the UDB, approximately 938 square miles. The planimetric layer for Miami-Dade County was previously digitized in 2001 by Woolpert, in 2012 by GPI Geospatial (GPI), and in 2020 by GPI. GPIs 2022 update utilized a Geodatabase provided by ITD for Miami-Dade County containing two layers to be updated: Water and Edge of Pavement. GPI used the recent set of county orthoimages, produced by Woolpert in 2022, to perform the update of the various feature classes. The feature classes were clipped into smaller blocks. Compilers made adjustments or recollected any missing features. The corresponding attributes were assigned to each separate shapefile as adjustments and new collection occurred. The shapefiles were then merged back together into a full file. Topological checks were performed to make sure the linework did not cross unexpectedly, ends dangled, or strange gaps exist in the collected features. Depending on the layer, different checks were done using the existing data layer to evaluate the completeness of the overall collection. The final layers were quality checked for formatting and file corruption before being sent to the client for review. Personnel that collected this data are either photogrammetrists trained in stereo collection or editors trained in ortho-photography based collection.
